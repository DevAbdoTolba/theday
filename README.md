## Features

- #### Displaying all semesters with their courses
  - Every semester has up to 6 courses, all of which are displayed in 2 conditions: on computers and wide screens, the abbreviations of every course are shown. On phones, the whole course name is displayed.

  - Every page in the courses has many sections in the Material section. For example, in the computer architecture course, we have sections, whitenning, lectures, online sections, and online lectures. Each section has 4 main items:
    - Title
    - Go-to drive button (which leads to the drive folder from which the data came)
    - Items themselves
    - Horzintal scroll bar
  - Every item has 4 main functionalities:
    - On hover, display the whole name.
    - On click, open the file.
    - Show the thumbnail of the file.
    - The width increases depending on the file's main size in KBs.
    
   


## How to install


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
